# Data

## Meteorological data

* Lots missing from NEON data for some reason; maybe sensors were offline?
* 1 meteorological station per site
* Units: rainfall--mm, relative humidity--?, temperature--degrees C
* Uncertainty units are %
* Consider pulling in external data source given the number of NAs 

## Tick data

* Sampler walks a transect dragging a 1m square cloth; ticks attach to it; get counted (standardized effort)
* Then ID nymphs and adults to species and count them 
* Larva rarely IDed to species 
* 4 replicates per site

# Research goals

1. Build a forecast for 2018 focusing on abundance 
1. May start with one site 
1. Aspirational: spatial random effects model or be more explicit about space
